# 6 security missconfiguration
One of the concerns when programming applications to avoid security miss configuration attackers will attempt to exploit unpatched bars or access to bank accounts and used pages unprotected files and directories etc to gain unauthorized access or knowledge of the system.


Security miss configuration can happen at any level of any application stack, including the network services platform web server application server.


database frameworks custom code and pre installed virtual machines containers for storage automated scanner some useful for detecting this configurations use the default accounts for configurations unnecessary services like this the options, etc.


Such laws frequently give attackers unauthorized access to some system data or functionality occasionally such laws, result in a complete system compromise, but this is impacted depends on the protection needs of the application and data.


The application might be vulnerable if the application is this inappropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack or improperly configure permissions on cloud services.


Unnecessary features are enabled or install like unnecessary ports services pages accounts or.


default accounts and their passwords still enabled and unchanged error handling reveals stack traces or other overland informative error messages to users.


For upgraded systems, ladies security features are disabled or not configured security.


The security settings in the application servers application frameworks like struts spring Asp net libraries databases, etc, not set to secure values server does not send security headers and directives or they are not set to secure values software is out of date or vulnerable.


Without concerted repeatable application security configuration process systems are at a higher risk.

## Examples
### scenario one the application server comes good sample applications that are not removed from the production server the sample applications have known security dos attack refuse to compromise the server.


If one of these applications as the admin console and default accounts won't change the attacker logged in with default passwords and takes over.


### scenario to directory listing is not disabled on the server and attacker to establish they consider list directories.


The attacker fines and downloads to compile Java classes, which they D compile and reverse engineer to view the Code, the attacker then finds a serious access control law in the application.


### scenario three the application servers configuration allows detail error messages like stack traces to be returned to users this potentially exposes sensitive information nation or underlying laws such as component versions that are known to be vulnerable.


### scenario four a phone service provider has default sharing permissions open to the Internet by other CSP users, this allows sensitive data stored within cloud storage to be accents.


Secure installation processes should be implemented.


A repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment for this property lockdown.


Development QA and production environments should all be configured identically different credentials use each environment this process should be automated to minimize the effort required to set up a new secure environment.


The mobile platform, without any unnecessary features components documentation and samples they move or do not install unused features and framework.


A task to review and update the configurations appropriate all security knows updates and patches as part of the patch management process, in particular, who you called storage permissions like s3 bucket permissions.


A segmented application architecture that provides effective secure separation between components for tenants and segmentation containerization for cloud security groups.


An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings in all environments.


What should you know about prospects.





##  section 2
WEBVTT

Three four cents and there are freely available in.


existence of the second most prevalent issue in the lost.


and found the nearly two thirds of all applications.


automated tools and find some extra problems are manifest, particularly in mature technology such as php J to w gst and he got half.


Of the three forms of exercise the impact of existence is moderate for both reflection access and dawn excellent says, and the impact of severe for storage, etc.


These attacks can result in remote code execution on the victims browser such as potential sessions or delivery malware.


For three forms and access our browsers reflected access the application or API food some validate with an unstable user input, as part of html output.


A successful attack and allow the attacker to execute arbitrary html and javascript in the browser typically the user will need to interact with some malicious link that points to an attacker controlled page, such as malicious watering hole websites advertisement or something.


store in excess yeah.


And sanitize user in first.

The application uses untrusted data and the construction of the following html snippet without validation for a statement.

20
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.410
This is a perfect example of code and data mixture.

21
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.880
In this case, the browser.

49
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:36.990
solution.

50
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.150
Is serialized.

51
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:50.190
and passing back and forth with each request and attack for nurses, they are 00 Java objects and ensure and uses the Java Su.

52
00:08:51.330 --> 00:09:15.150
To gain remote code execution on the application server into a php forum uses php object serialization to say a super cookie containing the users user ID role possible hash and other states and attacker changes the serialized object to give themselves admin privileges.

53
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:37.710
The only safe architectural pattern is not to accept some normalized objects from untrusted sources for to use serialization means that only primitive data types.

54
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:51.300
It sounds not possible see one or more of the following implementing integrity checks, such as digital signatures on n serialized objects to prevent possible object creation or data template.

55
00:09:52.470 --> 00:10:09.510
Enforcing script type constraints during the serialization before entrepreneur nation as the code typically expect a definable set of crisis bypasses to this technique i've been demonstrating so alliance Simon on this is not advising.

56
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.840
Isolating and running code that be serialized a roku deployments when possible.

57
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:26.700
Logging the serialization exceptions and failures, such as for the incoming tide is not the expected type or the DC realization throws exception.

58
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:35.910
Restricting monitoring incoming and outgoing network connectivity containers or servers that you see remote.

59
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:43.260
Monitoring serialization a learning that we use in the serialized is constantly.

60
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.040
Using software.

61
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:14.250
Is captured to secure application develop what should we do to avoid it while he's already.

62
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:22.020
turned around vulnerabilities other vulnerable, which requires constant effort to develop a custom exploits.

63
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:36.540
prevalence of this issue is very widespread component heavy development patterns to need to development team it's, not even when you're standing which can save us in their application or API much less keeping them up today.

64
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:45.150
Some scanners so get tired js help in detection, but determining exploit ability requires additional.

65
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.800
vulnerabilities only binary.

66
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:57.150
Software is vulnerable unsupported or out of date, this includes the Ls web application certain database management system cms applications API and all components runtime environments and library.

67
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:04.980
If you do not scan for vulnerabilities and subscribe to security bulletins related to the moment to view.

68
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:26.880
If you cannot fix or upgrade the underlying platform frameworks and in this space timely fashion, this only happens environments and patching is a monthly or quarterly task and change control, which leads organizations, open to many days or months of unnecessary exposure to fix.

69
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:34.800
Their software developers do not test the compatibility of updated upgraded okay why.

70
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.330
not secure the components configurations.

71
00:13:47.460 --> 00:14:02.040
components typically run with the same privileges as the application itself so balls in any component can result in serious and such laws can be accidental like coding error or intentional like back door and component.

72
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:20.550
Some example exploitable component vulnerabilities discovered our CV 2017 5638 a stretch to remote code execution vulnerability that enables execution of arbitrary code on the server has been blamed for significant breaches.

73
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:32.310
While Internet of Things iot are frequently difficult or impossible to patch the importance of patching and can be great such as biomedical devices.

74
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:48.810
There are automated tools to help attackers fine unpatched or miss configure systems, for example to show them iot search engine can help you find devices that still suffer from the heartbeat vulnerability patched in April 2014.

75
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:57.960
One option is not to use components that you didn't like but that's not very realistic.

76
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:08.220
There should be a patch management process in place to remove unused dependencies unnecessary features components files and documentation.

77
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:22.620
continuously inventory, the versions of both client side and server side components, such as frameworks and libraries and the dependencies using tools like versions dependency check retire decay, so instead of.

78
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:39.750
continuously monitor sources like see me and bb for vulnerabilities and the components you software composition analysis tools to automate the process subscribe to email alerts for security vulnerabilities related to conform to use.

79
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:50.520
Only attainable it's not official sources over secure link prefer side packages to reduce the chance of a modified malicious component.

80
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:57.990
monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not create security patches for older versions.

81
00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:06.630
Because it's not possible consider deploy a virtual patch to launder detect or protect against the discovery issue.

82
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:19.500
Every organization must ensure that there is an ongoing plan for monitoring triage and and applying updates or configuration changes to the lifetime of the application or portfolio.

83
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:47.190
What should you know about insufficient logging and monitoring exploitation of insufficient logging and monitoring is the bedrock of nearly every major incident.

84
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:57.360
attackers rely on the lack of monitoring timely response to achieve their goals without being detected, this issue is included in the top 10 based on.

85
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.740
One strategy for determining if you have sufficient on.

86
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.680
phone penetration.

87
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:15.180
testers actions should be recorded sufficiently to understand images they may have incentive most successful attack start with vulnerability probing.

88
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:29.850
Allowing such probes to continue can raise the likelihood of success to you 100% in 2016 identifying the breach is an aggregate 191 days plenty of time for damage to be inflicted.

89
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:45.120
Insufficient logging detection monitoring and active response occurs anytime auditable events such as logins failed logins and high value transactions are not logged.

90
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:55.650
warnings and errors generate know inadequate or unclear block messages logs of applications and api's are not monitored for suspicious activity.

91
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.680
logs are only stored locally.

92
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:05.520
Appropriate alerting threshold and response escalation processes are not in place for effective.

93
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:13.470
penetration testing and stands by desks tools such as for was that do not trigger alerts.

94
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:21.300
The application is unable to detect escalate for alert for active attacks in real time or near real time.

95
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:29.070
You are vulnerable to information with like logging and learning events visible to the user or an attacker.

96
00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:01.290
An open source forum software project run by a small team was hacked using a flaw and software.

97
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:18.960
The attackers managed to wipe out the internal source code repository containing the next version and all of the foreign contents all the source could be recovered lack of monitoring logging for alerting led to a far worse breach the forum software subject is no.

98
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.490

102
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.670
As for the risk of the data is stored or processed by the application.

103
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:25.740
ensure all invalid login attempts access control failures and server side input validation failures can be logged in sufficient user context to identify suspicious or malicious accounts.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:09.000
And held for sufficient time to allow the raid forensic analysis to ensure that logs are generated in a format that can be easily consumed by centralized log management solutions.

111
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:19.560
ensure high value transactions have an audit trail with integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion, such as append only database tables for similar.

112
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:28.080
establish effective monitoring and alerting such that suspicious activities are detected and responded to in a timely fashion.

There are commercial and open source application protection frameworks, such as a was APP Center web application firewalls such as MOD security would be oh was Mon security poor rule set and blog correlation software with custom dashboards and alerting.

115
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:12.540
Whether you're new to web application security or are already very familiar with these risks fantastic producing a secure web application for fixing an existing one can be difficult.

116
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:24.690
If you have to manage a large application portfolio, this can be daunting to help organizations and developers reduce their application security or cost effective manner or wants.

117
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:29.850
To address application.

118
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.530
Secure web application, you must have.

119
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.360
Your.

120
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:58.920
Patience oh last recommend to use the ios application security verification standard Asp s as a guide for settings security requirements for your application you're outsourcing consider the last secure software contract and.

121
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:17.730
Rather than retrofitting security into your applications is far more cost effective to design in the security right from the start you've heard of the overwatch absence and project for details on the successful security architecture.

122
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:58.290
security controls is difficult, using a set of standard security controls radically simplifies the development of secure applications and.

123
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:13.260
The almost proactive goals is a good starting point for developers and many modern frameworks now come with standard and effective security controls for optimization validation csrs prevention it's endless.

124
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:27.720
process your organization follows when building such applications oh was recommends the software assurance maturity model.

125
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:37.830
This model organization and implement for software security tailored to specific risks at your organization.

126
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:54.480
We all want education project provides training materials to help educate developers on web application security and has been filed a large list of a was educational presentations.

127
00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:06.690
For hands on learning about vulnerabilities try oh last web goat to stay current come to an O was upset conference oh was competence training for mobile a wasp chapter.

128
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:35.400
Now we secure code is important but it's critical to verify that the security you intended to build in is actually present correctly implemented and he's everywhere, it is supposed to be.

129
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.600
To go application security provide.

130
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:51.060
The work is difficult and complex and modern, high speed development processes like agile and devops have extreme pressure on traditional approaches and tools.

131
00:27:51.780 --> 00:28:07.500
So we strongly encourage you to put some thought into how you're going to focus on what's important across your entire application portfolio and do it cost effectively modern risks, so the days of scanning for penetration testing application.

132
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:29.070
development requires you to use application security testing across the entire software development lifecycle look to enhance existing development pipelines with security automation that doesn't slow development whatever approach you choose consider the annual cost expressed.

133
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:37.740
me a retest and redeploy a simple application multiplied by the size of your application portfolio.

134
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:52.200
before you start testing be sure you understand what's important to spend time on priorities come from the threat model, so you don't have one, we need to create one before testing.

135
00:28:54.300 --> 00:29:01.620
As vs and we are was testing guide as an input and don't rely on tool vendors, to decide what's important.

136
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.290
approach to applications.

137
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:32.130
must be highly compatible with the people processes and tools you use in your software development lifecycle as dlc.

138
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:46.830
Attempts to force extra steps gates and reviews are likely to cause friction get bypass and struggle to scale look for natural opportunities to gather security information and feed it back into your process.

139
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:57.210
choose the simplest fastest, most accurate technique to verify each require.

140
00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:03.000
Security knowledge and oh was application security.

141
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:07.830
Security.

142
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:57.690
don't want to start out testing everything focus on what's important and expand your verification program for the time that means expanding the set of security defenses and risks that are being automatically there as well as expanding the set of applications and a.

143
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.780
State where the essential structure of your all your applications and API is continuously.

144
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.160
No matter how good you are testing.

145
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:41.070
She communicated effectively build trust by showing understand how the application works describe clearly how it can be used without lingo and include an attack scenario to make it real make a realistic estimation of how difficult for vulnerability is to discover and explore.

146
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:48.450
That would be finally deliver findings in the tools development teams are using.

147
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.430
Security is no longer function increasing attack.

148
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.220
must establish and effective capabilities for security, there are.

149
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:13.830
staggering number of applications and lines of code already in production, many organizations are struggling to get a handle.

150
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:26.520
On wasp recommends that organization application security program to gain insight and improve security across their application for.

151
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:33.840
security requires many different parts of an organization to work together efficiently.

152
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:53.070
software development and business and executive management, it requires security to be visible, so that all the different players see and understand the organization's application security posture it also requires focus on the activities and outcomes that actually no.

153
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.960
fury or reducing risk in the most cost effective manner.

154
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:14.910
document all applications and associated data assets larger organization should consider implementing and configuration management database CD and DVD for this purpose.

155
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:35.850
establish an application security program and drive adoption, not the capability gap analysis comparing your organization to their peers, to the five key areas and an execution one day management approval and establish an application security awareness campaign for the entire it organization.

156
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.120
Yes, you want to identify prioritize your application from a business perspective.

157
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.610
I promise.

158
00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:05.040
Establish assurance guidelines to properly define the coverage and level of renewal required establishing upon risk rating model will be beneficial.

159
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:18.660
keep in mind the rating mom should include a consistent set of likely will impact factors reflective of your organization's tolerance for risk every organization is different, so the rating models could differ greatly.

160
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:34.470
To enable a strong foundation, you need to establish a set of focus policies and standards that providing application security baseline for all development teams to review to.

161
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:46.440
But you really do that it's important to define a common set of reusable security controls the compliment these policies and standards was by design and development guidance on their views.

162
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:58.230
Accurate the security controls have been properly defined, you can then establish an application security, training curriculum that was required and targeted to different development roles and topics.

163
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:22.590
You should define that in grade security implementation verification activities into existence development and operational processes by building security in round out the overall security of the organization and.

164
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.990
There are all sorts of verification activity integrate into your processes.

165
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.400
right on your design review.

166
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:45.060
Review penetration testing and remediation you should also provide subject matter, experts and support services for development and project teams to be really successful.

167
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:59.100
it's best to manage your metrics by the government and funding decisions based upon the veterans and analysis data capture.

168
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:09.990
metrics include adherence to security practices and activities vulnerabilities introduced vulnerabilities mitigated application coverage.

169
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:18.360
defect density by type and instance counts etc analyze data from the implementation and verification that should be.

170
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:31.710
Looking for root cause and vulnerability patterns, which will drive strategic and systemic improvements across the enterprise learn from mistakes and offer positive incentives to promote improvements.

171
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:49.260
Applications belong to the most complex systems humans regularly create and maintain it management for an application should be performed by IT specialists.

172
00:36:49.740 --> 00:37:00.540
who are responsible for the overall it life cycle of the application just establishing the goal of application manager as technical counterpart to the application on.

173
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:12.540
The application manager is in charge of the whole application lifecycle from the it perspective from the licensing requirements until the process of retiring systems, which is often overlooked.

174
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:40.620
We should collect them negotiate the business requirements for an application with the business, including the protection requirements with regard to confidentiality.

175
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:54.480
integrity and availability of all the assets and we expected business logic, then you meet compile the technical requirements include functional and non functional security requirements.

176
00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:03.480
plan and negotiate the budget that covers all aspects of design bill testing and operation, including security actually.

177
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:28.830
negotiate the requirements with internal or external developers painful new guidelines and security requirements with respect to your security programs like lc lc best practices great films all technical requirements planning.

178
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.760
Security and service levels.

179
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:39.690
and check with.

180
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.600
Your software conference.

181
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.750
Contract Law, please consult your advice before music the sample in.

182
00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:03.870
negotiate planning and design with the developers and internal shareholders like security specialist.

183
00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:15.240
defined security architecture controls and countermeasures appropriate to the protection and the expected threat model, this should be supported by security specialists.

184
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:29.550
You should worry about the application assessment name risks or provides additional resources in each sprint ensure security stories are created that include constraints added or non functional requirements.

185
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.680
automate the security of the application interfaces and all requires.

186
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.410
optimization.

187
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.180
Technical.

188
00:39:46.770 --> 00:40:00.480
The IP architecture and coordinate Business Test create use and abuse test cases from technical and business perspective managed security tests according to internal processes, the protection means.

189
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:13.440
application and operation and migrate from previous have used applications if needed finalize all documentation, including the change.

190
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:17.790
and security architecture.

191
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:30.630
operations must include guidelines for the security management of the application like patch management.

192
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:36.690
raise security awareness of users and manage conflicts that usability versus security.


plan and manage changes like migrating to new versions of the application or other components like os middleware and libraries update all documentation, including in the cmt be and the security architecture controls and countermeasures equally any run books or project documentation.


Any required data should be archived all other data should be securely white securely retiring the application, including the leading unused accounts roles and permissions set your application state to retired in the cm db.
